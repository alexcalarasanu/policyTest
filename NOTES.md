# Notes

First I decided to use an enum to differentiate between all the different types of discounts possible. This also makes 
it easy to add/remove new types.

Realised there needs to be a way to count the number of items of the same types that are bought so I added itemId for items

This implementation can be used as a skeleton to expand. If this was a proper project I would've done some refactoring for
the classes but the logic would be the same.
